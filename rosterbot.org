RosterBot is a tool for automatically generating duty rosters for teams. Operating on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming][Constraint Programming]], the software narrows the pool of schedules based on the specified restrictions, then iterates through them to find an optimal selection.

Built in Clojure, RosterBot is released under the GPL3. The following libraries are used by RosterBot:

* TODO [#A] Core Logic

** TODO [#A] Base Constraint Model

Constraint programming operates on a model of bounded variables which are reduced and restricted until a solution is found that meets all constraints. Constraints are defined in terms of variables.

*** DONE [#A] Model timespan with each day's shifts
CLOSED: [2016-12-10 Sat 00:56]

The most flexible option seems to be generating an ~employee-day~ matrix, by iterating through the date range, then iterating through the employee list. I'll map each assignment-state to a number: 

+ Assigned elsewhere :: ~-2~
+ Requested time off :: ~-1~
+ Unassigned :: ~0~
+ Shifts :: ~1–N~

*** DONE [#A] Model shift recurrence
CLOSED: [2016-12-10 Sat 01:00]

Shift restrictions will be added as constraints as the ~employee-day~ variables are generated. Shifts will have schedule options as follows:

+ Every ~X~ days
+ Specified days-of-week every ~X~ weeks

Shift exceptions can be specified as dates and date ranges, causing the modified shift to not be generated for those dates.

*** DONE [#A] Model shift restrictions
CLOSED: [2016-12-11 Sun 13:57]

I redesigned the shift-constraint model to generalize shift constraints from a single function. All arguments are keyword-args, as follows:

+ =:shifts= :: The collection of defined shifts
+ =:shift= :: The shift being restricted, may be a sequence or number
  + =count= :: An optional count, included as the second item in =:shift= as a sequence, defaults to =1=
+ =:follower= :: Optional shift-set to require after the shift. Can be =:out= (off, PTO, or outside assignment), =:other= (anything but the specified shift), =:off= (unscheduled or PTO), or a specified list of shifts; may be wrapped in a sequence
  + =count= :: An optional count, included as the second item in =:follower= as a sequence, defaults to =1=

These shift-constraints are generated as finite state automata and combined. The resulting automaton is used as the row constraint for each employee. 

I can optionally add the ability to set employee shift preferences, but that's a feature to consider later.

*** TODO [#A] Constrain employees by other obligations and personal requests

Employee scheduled days (whether PTO or exterior assignments) will be tracked in per-employee maps of ~date~ → ~out-shift~, where ~out-shift~ is either ~-1~ or ~-2~ for PTO or external assignments, respectively.

*** TODO [#A] Model balanced shift distribution

Balanced shift distribution can be defined in terms of two scores: 

+ How balanced an individual employee's shifts are across the time range
+ How balanced the total shifts are between the employees

These will need to be combined using the (possibly weighted) average of the two scores, and the list of solutions will be sorted by this average.

**** TODO [#A] Score per-employee shift balance

This is best calculated by breaking the time period into blocks of $1\over{6}$ the total time period and comparing the employee's optimal shift count per-block with the actual shift count in each block. Given the employee's total number of internal shifts $S_t$, the total number of days $T$, calculate the optimal number of shifts per-block $S_o$. Take the difference from $S_o$ of each per-block shift count $S_i$. Average those differences $D_i$ to produce $D_a$.

$$ S_o = {S_t \over 6} $$

$$ D_i = |S_o - S_i| $$

$$ D_a = {{\sum^5_{i=0} D_i} \over{6}} $$

**** TODO [#A] Score inter-employee shift balance

This is fairly easy to compute. Given the total number of internal shifts $S_t$, the total number of team members $T$, and the number of shifts assigned to each team member $S_i$, compute the average deviation $D_a$ from the optimal shift distribution $S_o$.

$$ S_o = {S_t\over{T}} $$

$$ D_i = |S_o - S_i| $$

$$ D_a = {{\sum^{T-1}_{i=0} D_i} \over{T}} $$
